## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Git installed ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

**Windows users:** After installing Git, restart your terminal/command prompt.

To verify Git is installed:
````bash
git --version
````

### Solution 2: Provide Alternative Installation (Better!)
````markdown
## Installation

### Option A: Install from GitHub (requires Git)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/codeislife12/chatsorter-client.git
```

### Option B: Install without Git
Download the repository as ZIP, extract it, then:
```bash
cd chatsorter-client
pip install .
```

### Option C: Direct install (coming soon)
```bash
pip install chatsorter-client  # When we publish to PyPI
```

## BETTER LONG-TERM SOLUTION:

**Publish to PyPI** so customers can just do:
```bash
pip install chatsorter-client
```

No Git needed!

## For NOW:

Add to your README:
```markdown
⚠️ **Important:** This installation method requires Git to be installed.

**Don't have Git?** 
- Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Mac: Comes pre-installed
- Linux: `sudo apt install git` or `sudo yum install git`

After installing Git, **restart your terminal** before running pip install.
```

**Continue roleplay - assume you installed Git and tried again. What happens next?**
